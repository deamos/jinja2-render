# docker-template
*A Python Tool to Simplify the Automated Creation of a Dockerfile Using Jinja2 Templates*

**docker-template** hugely simplifies building multi-module Docker images.
It is a Python script allowing to create Dockerfiles from a Jinja2 Template
and a (Python-based) configuration file (`build_configuration.py`).

This is useful for example in the following cases:

* Your Dockerfile contains a lot of repeated statements.
  They can be replaced by a [Jinja2 For Loop][].
* Your Dockerfile depends on a software with different versions
  and you want to simplify/automate switching between them.

### Workflow

```
              docker-template
          & build_configuration.py
                   â†“
                                   (optionally)
Dockerfile.jinja2  ðŸ¡†  Dockerfile,  Docker image
```

### Original Use Case

The script was originally developed to automate building different configurations
of the control system software EPICS and it's various modules.
Traditionally, those modules were installed by a single shell script with
fixed versions (i.e. synApps), which is bad in the Docker world
as a build failure at the end if it would require rebuilding everything before.
